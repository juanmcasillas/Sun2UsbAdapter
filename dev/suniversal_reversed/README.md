**NOTE** This code is a modified copy for preservation issues of [Alexander Vollschwitz's suniversal adapter](https://codeberg.org/xelalexv/suniversal). Please use his repo directly. Thanks. This code supports the mouse *without* added electronics, using the `altsoftserial` library with reversed serial logic.
